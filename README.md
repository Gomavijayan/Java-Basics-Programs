# Java-Basics-Programs

**Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.**


**The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Although it is primarily used for Internet-based applications, Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms**


# Applications of Java Programming Language

# Why is Java so important?
**Java can be used to create complete applications that can run on a single computer or be distributed across servers and clients in a network. As a result, you can use it to easily build mobile applications or run on desktop applications that use different operating systems and servers, such as Linux or Windows.**


# The advantages of Java are as follows:


**Java is easy to learn. Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
    Java is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
    Java is platform-independent.**

# Disadvantages of Java

  Java is slow and has a poor performance. Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than native languages such as C or C++.
  Java provides not so attractive look and feels of the GUI.
  Java provides no backup facility.
  Java requires significant memory space.
  Verbose and Complex codes.
